### Turning crumbs into kingdom.

The Mischief is an underground alliance of families.

Each clan controls its own racket, but they all answer to the same creed: **build, hustle, feast, repeat**.

At the top sits the [Dirty Dozen](./dirty-dozen), the twelve Dons who steer the tunnels, settle scores, and decide which caper cracks next.

Earn their trust, and every vault, printer farm, and neon-lit alley is yours to raid.
