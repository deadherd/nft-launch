### The backbone of the burrow.

**Twelve families. Twelve dons.**

They don't sit in offices. They don't shake hands on camera. They rule from the tunnels - by code, by claw, by reputation.

Each Don commands a family, each family controls a flavor of the mischief. The Dirty Dozen decide what gets printed, burned, hatched, or hidden.

This isn't politics. This isn't democracy. It's syndicate governance - where respect is earned, not given, and power is passed like a knife: blade-first.
