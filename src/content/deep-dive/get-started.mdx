### They build towers. We build tunnels.

The city's got you chasing your own tail. Another day, another tax, another fed on the corner playing dressup. 

Everyone's barking, no one's listening, and the whole place stinks of fear.

But down here? It's different.

This is where the noise dies, and the real hustle happens. Where ghosts trade secrets, and renegades make their name. A network of visionaries that grind harder, think sharper, and move quieter.

If you're hungry, hunted, or hellbent on success - dive in.

The [mischief](./mischief) is waiting.
