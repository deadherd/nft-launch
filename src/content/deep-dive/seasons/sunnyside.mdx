### Season 1

They call it Sunnyside, but don't be fooled... light don't reach here.

To the left, Glo-Co drips acid steam from rusted vents.

To the right, Slice 'n Dice grinds meat louder than it plays music.

The eggs? They glow, yeah, but so does the mold.

This is a backstreet hatchery beneath the grid where yolks glisten in neon gutterlight and every egg holds a secret.

In Sunnyside Alley, breakfast is sacred, and cracking one might wake something bigger than you bargained for.

You want in? Then earn your spot. Stack your shells, build your name.

No egg, no entry. No shellsâ€¦ no mercy.

**[Start](/) collecting eggs now!**
